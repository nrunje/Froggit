This was my final project for CS 1110 at Cornell University in Fall 2020.

              2) download a zip file of the master repository.
              3) create a folder named 'game' on desktop
              4) create a folder named 'froggit' inside of 'game' folder
              5) unzip master repository and place contents inside 'froggit' folder
              6) In your system command line, open 'game' folder
              7) Type 'python froggit' to play the game
